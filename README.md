Web Crawling and Search Engine Project
Overview
This project aims to build a basic yet functional search engine similar to Google's approach. It leverages Scrapy for web crawling, Scikit-Learn for indexing and ranking documents, and Flask to serve search queries. This document provides an overview of the project structure, setup instructions, usage, and contribution guidelines.

Features
Web Crawling: Automated spiders to crawl specified domains and collect documents.
Document Indexing: Utilizes TF-IDF scoring for indexing documents, enabling efficient search and relevance scoring.
Search Interface: A Flask-based web application allowing users to input queries and receive ranked search results.
Respect for robots.txt: Ensures ethical crawling by adhering to website-specific crawling restrictions.
